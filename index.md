    <p>
      Hi 👋! I am a Senior Software Engineer with 6+ years of experience specializing in backend and platform development.
    </p>

    <p>
    I currently work on building scalable, reliable systems and enjoy working close to the core of how platforms perform. My interests include distributed systems, performance optimization, cloud and developer tooling. Recently, I’ve been hooked on learning LLM inference and experimenting with agent design and orchestration, which has been a lot of fun to learn.
